- currently container crate 
- manual configuration like we do in server
- container need to rebiuld if you want update port or storage any conf 
- using docker commit create container image 
- devops will stuck in this and faced lots of problem in release new code 

# A Dockerfile is a text file containing step-by-step instructions to automatically build a Docker image

# FROM :::: 
- base image call --- like ubuntu redhat 
- OM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the base image for subsequent instructions

# Labels :::: 
- The LABEL instruction adds metadata to an image. A LABEL is a key-value pair
- basic info mention in image like Licence, Orgnization, product Details, author Details or any other relative metadata

# COPY ::::
- copy your data from base host to image path 
- copy use any data that availabel in your Dockerfile Path like src code, files and directory and others. 

# ADD ::::
- work smilier like copy 
- COPY data from sources like any thirdparty link in image 
- if you use tar then copy and extract in image 

# RUN :::: 
- if you want to run any command in image 
- RUN instruction will execute any commands 
- Execution Time is image build 
- Installing software or dependencies ; Creating directories or files needed by the application; Compiling application code one time excutes 

# CMD ::::
- CMD instruction sets the command to be executed 
- Execution Time is container start 
- Starting your application's main process 


# ENtrypoint 
- CMD instruction sets the command to be executed nut its override define entrypoint its not override 

# USER 
-  image when login default  login is root in container 
- user instructuion change your login user default in container 

# WORKDIR 
- Define your default directory 

# ARG 
- provide runtime enviorment variables for dockerfile 
- define user define values using ARG
